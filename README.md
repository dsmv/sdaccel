# SDAccel examples

## check_transfer

Program for check data transfer between host and Xilinx OpenCL device. I use ADM-PCIe-KU3 
  
Directory:
* *bin* - executable for QT application
* *qt*  - Qt application
* *sdx_wsp* - SDAccel application


There are two ways for build host application - Qt and SDAccell.
SDAccel used for primary debug OpenCL kernel and create simple console application.
Qt may be used for more complex application but this project used same code for Qt and SDAccel.

There are three test class:
* *TF_CheckTransferOut* - check data transfer from HOST to device
* *TF_CheckTransferIn*  - check data transfer from device to HOST
* *TF_CheckTransferInOut* - check data trnasfer for path: HOST-device-HOST

(only TF_CheckTransferOut is released now)

Program have two work mode:
* with test table	- for direct launch and launch from Qt 
* without test table	- for launch from SDAccel 

Test table is a text table with status information:
* *BlockWr* - count of written blocks
* *BlockRd* - count of read blocks
* *BlockOk* - count of correct blocks
* *BlockError* - count of incorrect blocks
* *SPD_CURRENT* - velocity of data transfer for last 4 seconds
* *SPD_AVR* - velocity of data transfer from test start

Arguments:
* -table  <flag_show>	: 1 - show table, 0 -	do not show table, default 0
* -time   <time> 	: execution time [s], default 10
* -file	  <fullpath>	: fullpath for xclbin 
* -size   <size>	: size block of bytes, default 65536
